I played football every year from seventh grade to senior year of highschool. Every season of football I have played I have gotten a major injury. In seventh grade I got my first concussion. Eigth grade my right should popped out 8 times and my left one 4 times over the course of the season. After the season I got surgery on my right arm for a torn labrum and loose ligaments. Freshman year my left should kept dislocating. 4 games in I had to get surgery on my left shoulder. Sophomore year I broke my thumb and was in a cast all season. Junior year my right knee cap reapetedly popped out. In the same season I discolacted two fingers and broke a broke in my hand, was in a cast for 3 months instead of surgery. Got knocked out in thanksgiving game of junior, recieved a concussion. Senior year I got heat stroke and had to be hospitalized.
