At the high school I attended it is mandatory we go on a internship for the last quarter of our senior year. I chose to intern at a gym called Crossfit Wicked. After spending 2 months training people, I knew I wanted to open an athletic training gym. I want to help athletes get stronger and prevent injuries.
